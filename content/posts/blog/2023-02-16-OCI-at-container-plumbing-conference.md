The OCI is sponsoring Container Plumbing Days 2023! After a year of postponement, Container Plumbing Days is back! Container Plumbing Days is a 2-day online event to investigate, discuss, hack, learn, and celebrate the “lower-level” open source container technologies, everything from the container runtime on down to the Linux kernel. If you're interested, you can register at: https://containerplumbing.org/
